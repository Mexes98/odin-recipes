    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan.
        She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food.</p>
    <p>At a time when most Americans thought 'Bolognese' was spaghetti sauce with 
        chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be.</p>
    <span>I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a 
        little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; 
            cook onion, celery, and carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. 
            Stir ground beef into vegetables and cook, stirring constantly until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 
            about 5 minutes. Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. 
            Cook, stirring often, until most of the milk has evaporated and 
            bottom of pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; 
            cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your fingers 
            until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into sauce; 
            fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, 
            at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from top of sauce if desired. 
            If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a little more water. 
            Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
