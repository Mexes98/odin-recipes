A basic html project from TOP

I have now finished this project, I 100% used html throughout.
It's my first time trying out something like this, and I'm happy I could do this all by myself.
As can be observed from my worktree, I had some troubles with Git but I figured it out. Really going to practice more to get the full hang of it.

Will update this some other time,when I add more changes to the project. And yeah, I love food.
So, ... for the love of food!!!
